PROJECT HALTED FOR THE TIME BEING

This project uses sports odds data across multiple sportsbooks from the https://the-odds-api.com/ API, and scans for arbitrage sports bets from those odds. Arbitrage bets are grouped together by event, and each event is displayed along with its applicable arbitrage data in an organized manner. An example of how the events are displayed is shown below.
